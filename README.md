## DegenToken

Simple Token Implementation
## Description

DegenToken is a basic Ethereum token implementation using the ERC-20 standard. It includes functionalities for minting, burning, and redeeming tokens for specific actions. The project serves as a starting point for those interested in learning about Ethereum token development or creating their custom tokens with specific behaviors.

Explore the code to understand the token contract structure and modify it to suit your requirements. This project can be used as a foundation for more advanced token development or integrated into decentralized applications.
## Installation

To download the project, clone the repository:
 https://github.com/madanrnsit/DegenToken.git

Make modification in the DegenToken.sol file
    
## Usage

1)Deploy the contract to the Ethereum network using Remix or another Solidity compiler. Make sure to set the name and symbol for your token.

2)Once the contract is deployed, call the mint function to create new tokens and assign them to an address. This function can only be called by the contract owner.

3)Use the transfer function to send tokens from one address to another.

4)Use the burn function to permanently remove tokens from circulation.
